## CIS3750 Group 9 - Mathematics ITS for Primary School Students

### System Overview
**Target Users:** Primary school students (ages 6-12) learning mathematics
**Core Features:** Skill assessment, adaptive learning, gamified activities, AI tutoring, and live professor sessions

### 10 Key User Stories Covering All Stakeholders & ITS Models

#### 1. Authentication & Onboarding (UI Model + Student Model)
**As a primary school student**, I want to sign up easily using my parent's Google account or phone number so that I can quickly start learning math without remembering complex passwords.

#### 2. Initial Skill Assessment (Domain Model + Student Model)
**As a primary school student**, I want to take a fun skill test with math problems when I first use the system so that it can understand what I already know and give me the right level of problems to practice.

#### 3. Adaptive Learning Path (Tutoring Model + Domain Model)
**As a primary school student**, I want the system to automatically give me harder or easier math problems based on how well I'm doing so that I'm always learning at just the right level for me.

#### 4. AI Tutor Support (Tutoring Model + UI Model)
**As a primary school student**, I want to ask questions to an AI math teacher anytime I'm confused so that I can get instant help and explanations even when no human teacher is available.

#### 5. Gamified Learning Activities (UI Model + Tutoring Model)
**As a primary school student**, I want to complete math adventure quests and earn rewards like badges and points so that practicing math feels like playing a fun game rather than doing homework.

#### 6. Live Professor Sessions (Tutoring Model + Student Model)
**As a primary school student with a premium plan**, I want to schedule one-on-one math lessons with a real professor at times that work for me so that I can get personalized help with concepts I find difficult.

#### 7. Parent Progress Monitoring (Student Model + UI Model)
**As a parent**, I want to see my child's math progress, time spent learning, and areas where they're struggling so that I can support their learning at home and celebrate their achievements.

#### 8. Teacher Content Management (Domain Model + Tutoring Model)
**As a math teacher**, I want to create custom math problems and organize them by topics like addition, subtraction, and multiplication so that I can align the system with my classroom curriculum.

#### 9. Intelligent Difficulty Adjustment (Student Model + Tutoring Model)
**As a primary school student**, I want the system to notice when I'm getting too many problems wrong and automatically provide easier practice problems or helpful hints so that I don't get frustrated and give up.

#### 10. Cross-Platform Accessibility (UI Model + Non-Functional)
**As a primary school student**, I want to use the math tutoring system on my tablet, phone, or computer with simple, colorful interfaces and voice instructions so that I can learn math anywhere and the technology doesn't get in my way.
